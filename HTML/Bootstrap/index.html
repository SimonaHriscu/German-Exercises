                <h2>Welcome to Berlin</h2> 
                <p>Berlin visitors have a choice of several city passes to help them navigate the city by public transport and offer discounts for museums, sights, attractions and bars, restaurants or clubs. Finding the right pass can be difficult, but we’ll do our best to help you find the best choice for your trip. The first step to finding your pass is to figure out as best you can what you want to do while visiting Berlin. It’s best not to let any single tourist discount pass or card dictate to you what you will see.   </p>
